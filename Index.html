                    Seattle beer is from the people and for the people. We ecnourage the general public to ditch corporate americas agenda and re-invest in our community brewerys.

                    Corpaorate beer lacks taste and this isn't in the sense of the taste of the beer but rather the way the franschis is modeled. They don't allow people to connect like local beer. Corporate America has beld us dry for far to long.
